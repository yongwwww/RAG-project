    "page_content": "In this paper, we propose a novel framework for multimodal emotion recognition which con- tains two innovative modules: The cross-modal locality-constrained context fusion leverages the transformer-based method to focus on localness, ef- fectively improved the multimodal interaction. The semantic refinement module makes full use of the semantic relation information from a global view. Experiments on two public datasets and the results demonstrate that our proposed CMCF-SRNet is su- perior to the existing state-of-the-art methods. The ablation experiments prove the effectiveness of the two innovative modules. The detailed discussion shows that our proposed CMCF-SRNet has satis- factory generalization ability and interpretability, indicating that it has the potential for practical use for emotion recognition.",
