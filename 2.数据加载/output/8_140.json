    "page_content": "Moreover, we conduct experiments with mul- tiple window sizes as presented in Fig. 10. The window size can be modified during the training period. A larger window size would result in bet- ter performance for cases where the inter and intra speaker dependencies are maintained for longer se- quences. In contrast, a smaller window size would be better where the topic frequently changes in di- alogues and speakers are less affected by another speaker. These results support our design combin- ing the locality-constrained attention and semantic refinement from a global-view.",
