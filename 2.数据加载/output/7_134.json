We easily notice a better for- mation of emotion clusters proving the necessity of capturing semantic dependency in utterances. Additionally, we conduct ablation experiments on the correlation-based RGCN and Semantic Graph- Transformer respectively, specifically, we respec- tively remove the semantic edge weight (SEW) in the RGCN and semantic-positional encoding (SPE) in the Graph-Transformer, after removing the SEW, WA and WF1 on IEMOCAP decreased by 2.6%, 1.9% respectively, while after removing the SPE, WA and WF! on IEMOCAP decreased by 3.2%, 2.7% respectively, which indicates that the proposed semantic encoder is necessary, the result in Table 4 shows the advantages of focusing on emotional semantic clues.",
