It mainly consists of two stages: relational seman- tic graph construction and semantic information refinement. The well-defined semantic graph is fed into a two-layer RGCN to compute semantic fea- tures of utterances and their interaction relations. Then the global semantic information is further extracted by a semantic graph-transformer.",
