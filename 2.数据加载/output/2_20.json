Recent ap- proaches like DAG-ERC (Shen et al., 2021) com- bined the advantages of conventional graph-based models and RNN-based models, a semantics GAT was employed to adjust the weight of knowl- edge (Tu et al., 2022), latent correlations have been leveraged among the utterances through a multi- branch graph network (Ren et al., 2022). Mean- while, existing GNN models use different aggrega- tion schemes for a node to aggregate feature mes- sages from its neighbors (Yuan et al., 2022): Graph convolutional networks use mean pooling while graph attention networks aggregate neighborhood information with trainable attention weights to cap- ture local details (Isufi et al., 2022). Furthermore, graph networks consider global graph information during aggregation and have been used to explore the semantic relationship between regional objects and",
